    "# Summary of Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "The house stock watcher API give us a full dataset of congress stock disclosures, which are mandated by the Federal Government. In project 3, we cleaned, explored, and tested this database, asking the question:\n",
    "Is there a difference in trading behavior between political parties?\n",
    "Our hypothesis test alluded to the fact that Republicans trade more money than Democrats. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will continue this analysis and build a prediction model that will answer the following question:\n",
    "\n",
    "Is is it possible to predict whether a representative is democratic or republican from their stock trades?\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are predicting Democratic and Republican, this is a classification problem. As such, our target variable will be the Party Affiliation column we added in the last project.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, since we are predicting Republican vs Democrat, we aren't necessarily trying to maximize either precision or recall, because we don't prefer false positives over false negatives, or vice versa. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, a good evaluation metric for this instance would be the f1 score, which uses the harmonic mean of precision and recall. Although our data is imbalanced to a certain extent, let's also keep an eye on accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Baseline Model\n",
    "For the Baseline Model, I wanted to choose interesting features that didn't require too much feature engineering so that I could further expand on them in the final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "I began with three features that seemed like the may have had some significance: District(Nominal), Type(Nominal), and amount(Ordinal)\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the sklearn documentation, for this kind of classification problem, you should first try LinearSVC classification model, so I chose that as my first model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Upon running the model, I was immediately given test accuracy of 0.98, and a f1_score of 0.998. (See Below)\n",
    "\n",
    "How is this possible? Had we already found the best model for this question?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, even with a train accuracy of 0.99 and a test accuracy of 0.98, there had to be some underlying reason that the model was giving such a high result \n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the district column tells us the whole story. The stock data that we have only goes back about two years, to January 2020. Thus, in the stock trades that have happened in that time, the representatives have most probably not changed office, and thus certain districts will always either be republican or democratic. The model was memorizing this information, and whenever we gave it a district from the test set, it knew what political party they were in because it had never seen the other party in these districts. If we had a lot more data, with many years of information, district would be more useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since I couldn't use district in it's current state, I decided to save it for further engineering in the final model. \n",
    "\n",
    "After taking away the district, my baseline model was left with two features: type(Nominal) and amount(Ordinal)\n",
    "\n",
    "The model gave training accuracy of 0.69699 and a testing accuracy of 0.69696, along with a f1 score of 0.401.\n",
    "Although this model is in no way at it's max effectiveness yet, it is more in line with what we expected to see at this stage. \n",
    "\n",
    "We know that republicans make up 1/3 of this dataset, with the rest being democrats. The accuracy also lines up closely with 70%, so there is a chance that this dataset is almost always guessing democrat, and only getting the republicans wrong, which still gets it an accuracy of around 70%. This is why it's also important to look at our main statistic, the f1 score, which in this case is quite low, at 0.4. We will work on raising this score in the final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Model\n",
    "For the final model, we want to focus on raising the f1 score.\n",
    "I first needed to assess my choice of model. So far, I had used LinearSVC to conduct my predictions, and while it was predicting with relatively high accuracy, I wanted a model that would increase my f1 score as well. Thus, I consulted the sklearn documentation which reccomends using KNeighbors after LinearSVC. I also like KNeighbors because it doesn't assume anything about the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "During our EDA in Project 03, we found that there may be a correlation between the month of the trade and the political party, so I wanted to use month in the final model as a nominal, one-hot encoded feature. We also saw in the last project that certain parties tend to prefer certain stocks and sectors, so I though ticker may be helpful as well \n",
    "Since both of these features contained NaNs, I had to do some quick data cleaning.\n",
    "Instead of the string, \"amount\" column, I decided to use the \"amounts(lower estimate)\" column of ints, as a ordinally encoded feature. I was also curious whether the \"title\" of the representatives could play a role in determining Political Party, and so engineered a feature that found the title(nominal) and one-hot encoded it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was now time to tackle the problem of the districts. On the surface, using the distance seems like a good idea becuase the district a representative is from can truly be a great predictor of their affiliation. However, because of the limited data we have, there's no way of using districts without the model memorizing them. Thus, I figured that if we generalized a bit, we may be able to engineer a feature that is more robust to memorization.\n",
    "I decided to make a new feature, called states. This would grab the name of the state from each district and onehot encode them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon seeing the results of the model, we got a very good test accuracy and f1 score, 0.98 and 0.97 respectively. However, I was still suspicous, and explored the data further to see that the state feature would also be heavily biased. Thus, I decided that the best idea would be to not use the district column altogether.\n",
    "\n",
    "This brought me to a total of 5 features for my final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of my model from using the rest of the features:\n",
    "\n",
    "Training accuracy: 0.95\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing accuracy: 0.89\n",
    "\n",
    "f1-score = 0.83\n",
    "\n",
    "While the model is slighty overfit, it is still able to predict party affiliations with a high degree of accuracy, and we see a major improvement in f1 score. \n",
    "\n",
    "I then cross-validated my model using grid search and the parameters n_neighbors and tree_nodes. The grid search returned a value of 1 for both. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Fairness Evaluation\n",
    "I lastly needed to asses my model for fairness. Looking at the distribution of the dataset, the amounts(lower estimate), there are far more values under 15000 than over 15000, at a 3:1 ratio. I wanted to make sure that the model was fair, and wasn't unfairly assuming the party based on the amount they traded.\n",
    "\n",
    "I decided that I would split my data based on the amount of money of the trade, to answer the question:\n",
    "\n",
    "Does my model fairly predict based on amount of money traded?\n",
    "\n",
    "I split my data, with one table with amounts <= 15000, and the other with amounts > 15000\n",
    "\n",
    "My hypothesis were as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Null: my model is fair; the precision of the two tables are roughly the same\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Alternative: my model is unfair; the precision for the amounts(less than 15000) is higher than the precision for the (amounts greater than 15000)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this permutation test, I decided to use the difference of precisions between amounts <= 15000 and amounts > 15000. My observed statistic was -0.059, which meant that there was a 5 percent difference in precisions between the two in the observed set.\n",
    "After running the permutation test, I recieved a P-value of 0.05 which meant that this difference in precision was only randomly possible 5% of the time. Thus, I must reject my null hypothesis which alludes to the fact that there is bias in my model based on amount of money traded."
